            <p>Lilo Café is still going strong! Since opening in 2009 we have consistently served, fed and welcomed our local community and friends from afar.</p>
            <p>During these uncertain times we continue to trade offering a fast and efficient take away service. We have a limited number of seats for dining in.</p>
            <p>Our La Marzocco coffee machine & mythos grinders continue to keep our neighbours caffeinated from 7am – 4pm.</p> 
            <p>Our cabinet is full of your favourite cakes, pastries, muffins and Turkish rolls. We also have fresh daily salads, soups, pies and toasted sandwiches.</p>
